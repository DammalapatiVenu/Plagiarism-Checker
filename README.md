# Plagiarism-Checker
Now a dayâ€™s plagiarism i.e., copying from others work and using it without any permission from the right owner has become so common that so many people do that and publish documents on their own name which is a crime. So as many software tools exist to find out plagiarism and detect that in any documents if something is copied or not. We have also seen this as a major problem in academics where students of UG, PG and PhD courses copying some part of original document.<br>
In this project, we will implement a very simple plagiarism detector. The input will be a set of documents and a potentially plagiarized document. The output will be the set of documents from which the document was plagiarized from. In this project, we will use basic detectors like KMP, LCSS, Rabin-Karp fingerprints to check the plagiarism.
